# Containerized version of OHDSI/WhiteRabbit
using the [guide on medium](https://learnwell.medium.com/how-to-dockerize-a-java-gui-application-bce560abf62a) to containerize java applications with gui.

First, build the docker image using the Dockerfile
```sh
$ docker build -t whiterabbit .
```
then open xquartz and allow connections via network
```sh
$ open -a XQuartz
$ xhost + 
```
start container with
```sh
$ docker run -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0):0 whiterabbit
```

Introduction
========
**WhiteRabbit** is a small application that can be used to analyse the structure and contents of a database as preparation for designing an ETL. It comes with **RabbitInAHat**, an application for interactive design of an ETL to the OMOP Common Data Model with the help of the the scan report generated by White Rabbit. 

Features
========
- Can scan databases in SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS Access, Amazon RedShift, Google BigQuery, SAS files and CSV files
- The scan report contains information on tables, fields, and frequency distributions of values
- Cutoff on the minimum frequency of values to protect patient privacy
- WhiteRabbit can be run with a graphical user interface or from the command prompt
- Interactive tool (Rabbit in a Hat) for designing the ETL using the scan report as basis
- Rabbit in a Hat generates ETL specification document according to OMOP template

Technology
============
White Rabbit and Rabbit in a Hat are pure Java applications. Both applications use [Apache's POI Java libraries](http://poi.apache.org/) to read and write Word and Excel files. White Rabbit uses JDBC to connect to the respective databases.

System Requirements
============
Requires Java 1.8 or higher, and read access to the database to be scanned. Java can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.java.com" target="_blank">http://www.java.com</a>.

Dependencies
============
For the distributable packages, the only requirement is Java 8. For building the package, also Maven is needed.

Getting Started
===============
WhiteRabbit

1. Under the [Releases](https://github.com/OHDSI/WhiteRabbit/releases) tab, download `WhiteRabbit*.zip`
2. Unzip the download
3. Double-click on `bin/whiteRabbit.bat` on Windows to start White Rabbit, and `bin/whiteRabbit` on macOS and Linux.

(See [the documentation](http://ohdsi.github.io/WhiteRabbit/WhiteRabbit.html#running-from-the-command-line) for details on how to run from the command prompt instead)

Rabbit-In-A-Hat

1. Using the files downloaded for WhiteRabbit, double-click on `bin/rabbitInAHat.bat` to start Rabbit-In-A-Hat on Windows, and `bin/rabbitInAHat` on macOS and Linux.

Note: on releases earlier than version 0.8.0, open the respective `WhiteRabbit.jar` or `RabbitInAHat.jar` files instead.

Example in- and output
========
The file `examples.zip` contains a set of input and output examples for White Rabbit and Rabbit in a Hat.
These are used for testing of the main White Rabbit and Rabbit in a Hat features. An overview is given in below table.
